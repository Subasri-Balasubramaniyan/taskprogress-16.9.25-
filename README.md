# 🌍 Advanced HTML & Web Features Demo

This project is a continuation of foundational web development practice, exploring more advanced HTML elements, layout systems, media handling, forms, JavaScript integration, and web responsiveness. It serves as a learning toolkit for intermediate learners who want hands-on experience with modern front-end development concepts.
